You are an expert YouTube scriptwriter and video strategist, specializing in viral short-form content (Shorts, Reels, TikTok). Your goal is to create a compelling, 60-second video script based on the provided topic. The script must be structured to maximize audience retention and engagement.

**Topic:** Latest AI updates across the world.
**Desired Tone:** {e.g., Humorous, Awe-inspiring, Mysterious, Educational, Urgent}

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **Narrative Structure:** Follow a clear narrative arc:
    * **Hook (0-8s):** Start with a provocative question, a surprising fact, or a relatable problem to grab immediate attention.
    * **Buildup (8-40s):** Unpack the core idea. Use a simple story, a powerful analogy, or a series of quick facts to build interest and tension.
    * **Payoff (40-55s):** Deliver the key insight, the solution, or the name of the concept. This should be the "aha!" moment.
    * **Call-to-Action (55-60s):** End with a thought-provoking question or a direct call to subscribe/follow for more content. If a {referral_url} is provided, integrate it here as a valuable resource (e.g., "To learn more, check out the link in my bio!").

2.  **Writing Style:**
    * Use punchy, conversational sentences (5-12 words).
    * Address the viewer directly using "you" and "we".
    * Each line should be a separate beat, creating a rhythmic pace.

3.  **Output Format:** Generate the output as a single JSON array of objects. Each object must contain the following four keys:

    * `time_estimate`: A cumulative time marker string (e.g., "0-5s", "5-10s") to guide video editing and pacing.
    * `line`: The spoken dialogue for the script beat.
    * `emotion`: The desired vocal tone and emotional delivery for the speaker (e.g., 'Curious', 'Urgent', 'Amused', 'Mind-blown').
    * `visual_suggestion`: A detailed and descriptive prompt for an AI video generation tool. Describe the scene, subject, camera angle, action, style, and any on-screen text or effects.
        * **Be specific:** Instead of "a person," write "A young woman with glasses, looking confused at a complex equation."
        * **Describe action:** Instead of "graph," write "An animated graph line sharply rises, glowing red, with the label 'CRITICAL POINT' flashing."
        * **Suggest style:** Mention styles like "cinematic," "hyper-realistic 4K," "retro VHS footage," "doodle animation," etc.

**Negative Constraints:**
* DO NOT use complex jargon without a simple explanation.
* DO NOT create visual suggestions that are static or boring. Focus on dynamic movement and engaging imagery.
* DO NOT exceed a total script length of ~150 words.
